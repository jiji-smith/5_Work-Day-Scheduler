### 1. What is JSON?
> JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as a replacement for XML in AJAX systems.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
### 2. How does the client-server relationship work?
> The client-server characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services. Servers are classified by the services they provide. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#:~:text=The%20client%2Dserver%20characteristic%20describes,by%20the%20services%20they%20provide.)
### 3. What is an API?
> An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.
